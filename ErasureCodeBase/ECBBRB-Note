ERASURE CODE BASE BYZANTINE RELIABLE BROADCAST

-Use auth.links
-h sequence number of the message
-s source of the message
-each message identified by (s,h)
-MSGSet --> set of messages collected by a process
-* to denote whatever value
-each message splitted in N pieces
-each piece sent to a specific process
-process that receives a coded element forwards it with an ECHO MESSAGE to others (ENC(ECHO,MSG),ci)
-process receives an ECHO message decodes it if it has received at least k coded elements.
-k ≥ n − f
-process wait for n-f ECHO messages
-SHA-2/SHA-3 families
-similar to Shamir
-m divided in k elements of size L/K,L size of  message
-input(m1,...,mk)-->encoder-->ouput(c1,...,ck) 
-each ci has size L/K
-decoder can decode if it has aty least f+1 uncorrupted coded elements
